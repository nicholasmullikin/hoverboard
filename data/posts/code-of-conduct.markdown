# # Rules

# 1
	Build something high school students can use related to learning. That’s the only parameter, but integrate APIs from our sponsors for brownie points and API prizes. You can make your project in any language(s) and programs you wish. Projects will be judged on complexity of code, aesthetic quality, and creativity/usefulness of the idea. 
# 2
	All teams must present their projects in less than three minutes, sending one presenter per team, and must run the project in real time on a team members’ device for the presentation.
# 3
	Feel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, shortcuts, or workarounds you’ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. You may use any frameworks, hosting services, etc. 
# 4
	Teams must compete in groups of 2-4 students, and are allowed to be mixed from different schools.
# 5	
	Each school represented must have one adult chaperone employed by the school at the hackathon on Sunday.
# 6
 	Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.
# 7
	Most importantly – have fun! This is a learning event so feel free to consult any documentation, mentors, and tutorials that you wish, but all code should be completed by team members.
